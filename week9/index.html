        <img src="logo.gif" alt="dog"/>
        <p>
            I change the photo's size and change the the mode into color index. I think the size is the best size for a title. Because I think make these changes can make the picture more clear and easy to see.

        <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo"/>
        <p>
            I change the photo's size and make it smaller. It is 1024 x 768 px 72 ppi. I also change the mode into color index and change the quality into high. Because I think it can fit into 800x600's screen.
