         <P>
             The reason why I choose this picture is my boyfriend's decision. I want to make a conunter strike skin trade cover at first. But I encounter some problems about the picture. So I choose this picture. I change the light of this picture and removed the flaw on my face. Then put some text on the magazine cover, made it seems like an "Time" style magazine.
